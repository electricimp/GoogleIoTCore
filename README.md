# GoogleIoTCore #

This library allows your agent code to work with [Google IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:
- [Registering a device](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/getting-started#device_registration) in Google IoT Core (optional feature).
- [Connecting and disconnecting](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/mqtt-bridge) to/from Google IoT Core.
- [Publishing telemetry events](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/mqtt-bridge#publishing_telemetry_events) to Google IoT Core.
- [Receiving configurations](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/config/configuring-devices) from Google IoT Core.
- [Reporting a device state](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/config/getting-state#reporting_device_state) to Google IoT Core.

The library provides an opportunity to work via [different transports](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/concepts/protocols), but currently supports [MQTT transport](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/mqtt-bridge) only.

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "GoogleIoTCore.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code**.

## Library Usage ##

The library API specification is described [here](#api-specification).

The [working examples](./examples) are provided together with the library and described [here](./examples/README.md).

Below sections explain the main usage steps and recommendations.

### Prerequisites ###

Before using the library you need to have an account in [Google IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/), setup it for your project and obtain the following information:
- [Project ID](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/requirements#permitted_characters_and_size_requirements).
- [Cloud region](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/requirements#cloud_regions).
- [Registry ID](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/requirements#permitted_characters_and_size_requirements).

Google IoT Core setup is described in the [instruction](./examples/README.md) for the examples.

Project ID, Cloud region and Registry ID may be identical for all your devices and be pre-hardcoded in your application or obtained, eg. from your server/cloud, after the first start of the application.

Also, for every device you need to have:
- [Device ID](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/requirements#permitted_characters_and_size_requirements).
- Public/private keys pair.

Registry ID / Device ID combination must be unique for every device in your project. More information about public/private keys and Device ID see in the [Authentication and Registration](#authentication-and-registration) section.

Device ID and private key need to be obtained, eg. from your server/cloud, after the first start of your application.

The mentioned above settings (Project ID, Device ID, private key, etc.) must be passed to the library after every restart of the application. For all non-hardcoded settings you may decide either to obtain them again after every restart, or save them locally in non-volatile memory.

Finally, you should decide which [Transport](#transport) your application/device is going to use for communication with Google IoT Core.

### Instantiation ###

To start working with the library you should create an instance of the GoogleIoTCore.Client class. Most of the settings mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section are passed to the client's constructor. Also, the constructor has additional options which controls the behavior of the library.

It is possible to instantiate several clients (TODO - true?) but note that Google IoT Core supports only one connection per device.

### Authentication and Registration ###

TODO - update

Each Google IoT Core device should have its own public and private RSA keys (Elliptic Curve is also supported by Google IoT Core, but is not supported by imp).

Public key is saved inside the Google IoT Core platform, so it is used only when registering a device in Google IoT Core. Private key is used on the client's side when connecting to the Google IoT Core servers.

Currently EI-agent can't generate a pair of RSA keys, so these keys should be generated by some provisioner and delivered to the agent.
Then you have two options:
1. This library can register a device in Google IoT Core and set a public key for it. Both public and private keys should be delivered to the agent. Also, the agent should have credentials for Google IoT Core device registry.
1. Right after generation of keys the provisioner can register a device in Google IoT Core and set a public key for it. Only private key should be delivered to the agent.

Google [recommends](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/concepts/device-security#provisioning_credentials) the second way for production purposes.

### Transport ###

TODO

### Connection ###

TODO

### Automatic JWT Token Refreshing ###

[JWT token](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/credentials/jwts) has an expiration time, so it should be updated before expiration to prevent the client from unexpected disconnection. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the `tokenAutoRefresh` [client's option](#options-1) to `False`.

For MQTT Transport the client implements the following token updating algorithm:
1. Using a timer wakes up when the current JWT token is near to expiration.
1. Waits for all current MQTT operations to be finished.
1. Calculates a new JWT token.
1. Disconnects from the MQTT broker.
1. Connects to the MQTT broker again using the new JWT token as an MQTT client's password.
1. Subscribes to the topics which were subscribed to before the reconnection.
1. Sets the timer for the new JWT token expiration.

The library does these operations automatically and invisibly. All the API calls, made at the time of updating, are scheduled in a queue and processed right after the token updating algorithm is successfuly finished. If the token update fails, the onDisconnected() callback is called (if the callback has been set).

### Telemetry Publishing ###

TODO

### State Reporting ###

TODO

### Configuration Receiving ###

TODO

### Pending Requests ###

All requests to a remote server are made asynchronously, so several operations can be processed concurrently. But only limited number of pending operations of the same type is allowed. This number can be changed in [the client's options](#options-1). If you exceed this number, the `GOOGLE_IOT_CORE_ERROR_OP_NOT_ALLOWED_NOW` error will be returned in response to your call.

### Errors Processing ###

```

#### setOnConnected(*callback*) ####

This method sets [*onConnected*](#callback-onconnectederror) callback. The method returns nothing.

#### setOnDisconnected(*callback*) ####

This method sets [*onDisconnected*](#callback-ondisconnectederror) callback. The method returns nothing.

#### setPrivateKey(privateKey) ####

This method sets [Private key](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/credentials/keys). The method returns nothing.

#### register(*iss, secret, publicKey[, onRegistered[, name[, keyFormat]]]*) ####

This complementary method registers the device in Google IoT Core.

It makes the minimal required registration - only one private-public key pair, without expiration setting, is registered.

First, the method attempts to find already existing device with the device ID specified in the client’s constructor and compare that device’s public key with the key passed in. And then:
- If no device found, the method tries to register the new one.
- Else if a device is found and the keys are identical, the method succeeds, assuming the device is already registered.
- Otherwise, the method returns the `GOOGLE_IOT_CORE_ERROR_ALREADY_REGISTERED` error. (TODO - Not confusing?)

**If you are going to use this method, add** `#require "OAuth2.agent.lib.nut:2.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code**.

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the [*onRegistered*](#callback-onregisterederror) callback if specified in this method.
